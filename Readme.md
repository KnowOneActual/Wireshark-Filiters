A Wireshark filter is a rule that is used to select specific packets to be displayed in the Wireshark packet capture window. Filters can be used to filter packets based on their source or destination IP address, port number, protocol, or other properties.

Wireshark filters are written in a special filter language that is similar to the regular expression language. Filters can be entered in the Wireshark filter bar or in the Display Filters dialog box.

Wireshark filters can be used to troubleshoot network problems, analyze network traffic, and monitor network security. They are a powerful tool that can be used to gain insights into network traffic.
