Work in progess. I'm using this as a data dump as I learn


LLDP FITLER -- eth.type == 0x88cc 
CDP Filter -- cdp.version == 2 
Signs port scanning of tcp -- tcp.flages.syn == 1 
Signs port scanning of udp -- udp.flags.syn == 1 
lldp-- eth.addr== 01:80:c2:00:00:0e  
cdp-- eth.addr== 01:00:0c:cc:cc:cc 
Bad TCP Flags without window update -- tcp.analysis.flags && !tcp.analysis.window_update  
search for multi TCP ports example -- tcp.port in {80,443,8000..8004}   
exclude some basic chatter !(arp or stp or lldp or cdp or eth.addr==ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff)  
Slow http times --http.time > 1

eq, ==    Equal
ne, !=    Not Equal
gt, >     Greater Than
lt, <     Less Than
ge, >=    Greater than or Equal to
le, <=    Less than or Equal to

eq, any_eq, ==    Any field must be equal
ne, all_ne, !=    All fields must be not equal
    all_eq, ===   All fields must be equal
    any_ne, !==   Any fields must be not equal

match operators
contains     Does the protocol, field or slice contain a value
matches, ~   Does the string match the given case-insensitive
             Perl-compatible regular expression
